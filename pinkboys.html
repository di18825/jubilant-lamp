				<p>The story of a brave boy who makes them boys wink. Careful, boys, he's out to steal your man and your nan.</p>

			</article>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Billy who loved to wear pink. He had a pink t-shirt, pink shorts, pink shoes, and even a pink backpack. Whenever he wore his pink outfit, he felt happy and confident.
			<p>One day, Billy decided to wear his pink outfit to school. As he walked into the classroom, he noticed that all the boys were staring at him and winking. Billy felt confused and didn't know what was going on.
			<p>During breaktime, Billy went outside to play footy with the other boys. But as soon as he stepped onto the field, all the boys started winking at him again. Billy felt embarrassed and didn't want to play anymore.
			<p>At lunchtime, Billy sat alone at a table and ate his peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Suddenly, a group of boys walked up to him and started winking again. But this time, they were also giggling and whispering to each other.
			<p>Billy felt frustrated and asked the boys what was going on. One of the boys finally spoke up and said, "Billy, we're winking at you because you look so cool in your pink outfit! We wish we could wear pink too, but we're too afraid of what other people will think. You're so brave for being yourself!"
			<p>Billy felt relieved and happy. He realised that he had been worried for nothing and that it was okay to be different. From that day on, Billy continued to wear his pink outfit to school, and all the boys cheered him on and even started wearing pink themselves.
			<p>And so, Billy learned that being true to yourself is always the best choice, even if it means standing out from the crowd. The end.

					<h3>Is your lawyer not wearing pink? If not, they should be.</h3>

				<p>Always hire lawyers wearing pink if you want to get the judge to wink.</p>

			</article>Pink is a colour that is often associated with femininity, romance, and playfulness. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to reclaim pink as a powerful and empowering colour for people of all genders. This movement has been embraced by people from all walks of life, including lawyers.
			<p>At first glance, the idea of lawyers wearing pink may seem frivolous or even inappropriate. After all, lawyers are often seen as serious, sober-minded professionals who need to project an air of authority and competence. However, there are several compelling reasons why lawyers should consider adding a touch of pink to their wardrobe.
			<p>First and foremost, wearing pink can help to break down traditional gender stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and diverse legal profession. Lawyers are often seen as being male-dominated and exclusionary, and many women and non-binary lawyers feel that they need to conform to traditional masculine dress codes in order to be taken seriously. By wearing pink, lawyers can challenge these stereotypes and help to create a more welcoming and accepting environment for people of all genders.
			<p>Moreover, pink can be a powerful tool for building connections and establishing trust with clients. When lawyers wear pink, they send a message that they are approachable, empathetic, and understanding. This can be especially important in fields like family law, where clients may be dealing with sensitive and emotional issues.
			<p>In addition, wearing pink can help lawyers to stand out in a crowded and competitive field. While it's important for lawyers to project a professional and polished image, it's also important for them to be memorable and distinctive. Wearing pink can help lawyers to differentiate themselves from their peers and create a strong and memorable brand.
			<p>Of course, there are some caveats to consider when it comes to wearing pink in a professional context. It's important to choose the right shade of pink and to pair it with appropriate accessories and clothing items to create a cohesive and professional look. It's also important to be aware of the expectations of clients and colleagues, and to ensure that wearing pink is not seen as a distraction or a violation of professional norms.
			<p>In conclusion, while it may not be for everyone, there are some compelling reasons why lawyers should consider wearing pink. From challenging gender stereotypes to building connections with clients, wearing pink can be a powerful tool for lawyers who want to stand out in a competitive and fast-paced profession. So, the next time you're putting together your wardrobe for a day in court or a client meeting, consider adding a touch of pink to your outfit and see how it feels. You may be surprised at the impact it can have!
